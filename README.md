<h2>Program Thinking:</h2>

A stack is a linear data structure which follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) property. LIFO means that the data most recently added is the first data to be removed. (Imagine a stack of books, or a stack of papers on a desk—the first one to be removed is the last one placed on top.)
A queue is another linear data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) property. FIFO means that the data added first is the first to be removed (like a line in a grocery store—the first person in line is the first to checkout).
